1. https://github.com/seliayeu/cmput404-lab4
2. A startup page telling you the server is running properly on Django 3.1.
3. You get a Page not found 404 on / and the message "Hello, world. You're at the polls index." on /polls/ 
4. Migrations are actions that allow you to propogate changes you make to models to your database schema (description from here https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/migrations/)
5. You see your username, "Authentication and Authorizaiton" and models for the directory polls created with manage.py startapp. For custom models, you create new schema in your models.py files.
6. You see "You're looking at question 38." at /polls/38/, "You're looking at the results of question 38." at /polls/38/results and "You're voting on question 38." at polls/38/vote. If you use a string, it doesn't work and to make it work you would replace <int:question_id> with <str:question_id> or <question_id>. 
7. It makes it harder to change the base directory and move where files are able to be found around as you write more code.
8. You can reuse code more easily via inheritance and use pre-existing views to speed up development. You should use a generic view if there's one that covers the features you need but you shouldn't if there aren't any that suite your needs.
